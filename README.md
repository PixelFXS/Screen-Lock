# Screen-Lock
Functional for mandatory login, allowing data registration before using a machine.


This screen lock consumes the keyboard shortcuts which do not allow the use of the screen, since it is executed with each new task. It only stops with a forced restart (not recommended as it damages your SSD), to stop the blocking you can configure a single text entry (username and password).
